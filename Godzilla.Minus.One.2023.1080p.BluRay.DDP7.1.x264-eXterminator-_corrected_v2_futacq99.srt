1
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:18,059
Odo Island Airfield,
final days of World War II

2
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,328
Odo Island Navy Detachment

3
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:20,598
- Eijiro!
- Yes.

4
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:24,637
Engine normal.

5
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:25,505
Roger.

6
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,042
- Fully refueled.
- Roger.

7
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:37,926
Ensign Shikishima?

8
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:43,969
Tsukuba Naval Air Corps, Tachibana.
Remember me?

9
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:48,431
Of course.
I am greatly in your debt.

10
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:53,652
I'm amazed you were able to land 
that bucket of bolts...

11
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,775
on this Swiss cheese of a runway.

12
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,998
You haven't lost your touch.

13
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:04,420
In simulated dogfights, no,
but suddenly I'm a real kamikaze pilot.

14
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,595
Then be grateful for the downtime.

15
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:14,450
But it's odd...

16
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,783
We've scoured your rig
and can't find anything wrong.

17
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,667
What are you implying?

18
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:51,844
I'm on your side.
We need more people like you.

19
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:04,666
Why obey an order to "die honorably"
when the outcome is already clear?

20
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,706
- Get the guns!
- Yes, sir!

21
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,346
- Enemy raid?
- I don't know!

22
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,650
- What is it?
- Something big!

23
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:10,190
A new Yankee weapon?

24
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,900
Taki! Taki!

25
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,285
- Light the beach!
- Roger!

26
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,315
Taki!

27
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,534
What in the hell?

28
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:37,799
It's Godzilla.

29
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:40,579
- What?
- A local told me.

30
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:44,034
It brings up deep sea fish.
Godzilla they call it.

31
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:45,354
G-G-Godzilla?

32
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:52,832
We're screwed.

33
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:56,926
Take cover!
Take cover!

34
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:09,867
What the hell is it?

35
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,601
Nobody knows.

36
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,490
- Ensign Shikishima.
- Sir?

37
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,806
Can you reach your 20 mm gun?

38
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,880
You're our only gunner.
We're just mechanics.

39
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,385
But what if it only makes it angry?

40
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,190
A 20-mm gun can kill anything!

41
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,412
Hurry, before it gets too close.

42
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:34,449
Go! Now!

43
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,619
Go!

44
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:38,471
Hurry.

45
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,930
What's he doing in there?

46
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,151
Quick, shoot.

47
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:33,317
It's coming this way.

48
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:36,817
- What do we do, sir?
- Ammo!

49
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:37,840
Fetch the ammo!

50
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,305
You idiot! Don't shoot!

51
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,549
Cease fire!

52
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:50,933
Fall back!

53
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,925
Fall back! Fall back!

54
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,294
Retreat!

55
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:06,470
Sir Tachibana!

56
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:49,368
I'll draw it this way. Shoot to kill!

57
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,935
You guys didn't deserve this.

58
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:16,821
Hey!

59
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:27,563
Everybody's dead!

60
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,321
They're all dead!

61
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:36,286
Because you didn't shoot!

62
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:42,263
Damn it!

63
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:21,956
You...

64
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,448
Hey!

65
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:06,720
Tokyo, December 1945

66
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,573
Watch where you're stepping, man.

67
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,692
Is that you, Koichi?

68
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:26,999
Sumiko!

69
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,370
How is this possible?

70
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,708
Weren't you a kamikaze pilot?

71
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:42,925
You have the nerve to show your face?

72
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,679
You're a disgrace!

73
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,055
Look what happened because of 
cowards like you!

74
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,629
If you'd only done your job...

75
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,055
My children wouldn't have died.

76
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,522
Do you know if my parents survived?

77
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,906
Everybody's dead.

78
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:26,750
This whole place was engulfed in flames.

79
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,495
Your folks, too.

80
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,058
My children met the same fate.

81
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:54,253
"My dearest son, Koichi..."

82
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,725
"Come back alive," right?

83
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,134
That's what you said.

84
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,629
Stop, thief!

85
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,708
Out of my way!

86
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:27,458
- Move!
- Grab that woman!

87
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,031
- Please!
- What?

88
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:34,680
Get back here!
Stop!

89
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:38,743
What...

90
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,736
Hey!

91
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,149
Finally.
Where did you go?

92
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:19,256
It's your fault for sitting out 
in the open.

93
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,759
I'd be seen.

94
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:23,428
You've been here the whole time?

95
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:29,338
Yeah, waiting for you to get up and move.

96
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:31,827
I bet you're hungry.

97
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,179
Why didn't you just abandon her?

98
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:38,788
Hey!

99
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,385
And leave her in a place like that?

100
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:47,487
No?

101
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,338
Interesting.

102
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:56,670
Please don't follow me.

103
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,203
Are you going to leave us 
to die on the street?

104
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:01,440
I don't care.

105
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,259
After you're done, you're leaving.

106
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:13,594
Hear that?
He's so mean and scary.

107
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,519
Where's your husband?

108
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,655
Is he a soldier?

109
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,562
Do I look like I'd have a husband?

110
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,530
What?

111
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,734
Whose kid is she?

112
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:32,542
- Does it matter?
- Of course, it does!

113
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,252
During the air raids...

114
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,590
her dying mother begged me.

115
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:44,605
So you...

116
00:15:45,824 --> 00:15:48,355
have no relation to that child?

117
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:50,812
Nope. So what?

118
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,241
What are you, stupid?

119
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:59,346
You're in no state to care for a baby.

120
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,958
You couldn't leave her either.

121
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:09,863
Name?

122
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,272
"Akiko"

123
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,060
No, I meant you.

124
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:21,491
Noriko.

125
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:29,491
Why do you dress like a vagrant?
By choice?

126
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,748
Well, I'm no harlot.

127
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:33,334
Don't look insulted.

128
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,926
You've got to survive somehow.
Who could blame you?

129
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,838
What about family?

130
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:55,954
"Haru Shikishima" "Eiichiro Shikishima"

131
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,224
Your parents?

132
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:02,565
Yes.

133
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:07,641
They were killed in the air raids.

134
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:13,934
Then you and I are the same.

135
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,504
What?
No, you can't...

136
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,176
stay...

137
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:54,931
Hey!

138
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:58,798
What's the story?

139
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,424
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

140
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,346
The mother and child you picked up.

141
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:09,510
Think you're some kind of saint?

142
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:10,542
No.

143
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,645
They just showed up.

144
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,262
If they're staying, you picked them up.

145
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:23,875
It's a bit late to play the hero.

146
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:29,792
Count me out.
I'm through caring.

147
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:35,614
Wait.

148
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:40,059
Is that girl able to breastfeed?

149
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,937
No, she's not the child's mother.

150
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:48,941
Say what?

151
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:04,500
At this rate, 
she'll die of malnutrition.

152
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:06,095
Right?

153
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:12,364
So you found a child but you have
no idea how to care for it.

154
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:14,276
What were you thinking?

155
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,278
I don't know.

156
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,916
It's not for you.

157
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,663
Adults can survive on anything.

158
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,370
Use it to make rice gruel.

159
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,107
Well...

160
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,892
there goes my prized white rice.

161
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:46,965
What a nuisance, I swear.

162
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:57,999
March 1946

163
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,083
Damn it.
I'm soaking wet.

164
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:10,296
Have you found a job yet?

165
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,460
Well I did find something.

166
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,898
What's that?

167
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,703
Money's not bad, either.

168
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:24,505
Look. They even paid an advance 
of 3,000 yen.

169
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,173
That's wonderful!

170
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:35,557
It must be a scam, like the rice you 
carried that got stolen.

171
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,860
It's nothing like that.

172
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,798
What makes you so sure?

173
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,036
It's government approved.

174
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,805
There's a reason why it pays well.

175
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,129
What reason?

176
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:53,199
During the war, both sides laid
thousands of mines in the sea.

177
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,764
This is a clean up job.

178
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:59,684
But the pay is extremely good 
because, well...

179
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:08,000
it comes with a certain amount of risk.

180
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,411
What are you, crazy?
You just survived a war.

181
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:15,109
What else can I do?

182
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:19,283
At this rate, we'll starve.
Akiko's life depends on it.

183
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,491
I understand that, but...

184
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:27,631
This brings in money.

185
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:32,237
With money,
we can even buy American powdered milk!

186
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:33,764
For that, I'd do...

187
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,311
I forbid you to die!

188
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:45,827
Don't worry. Just because it's 
dangerous doesn't mean I'll die.

189
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,833
It's not like kamikaze pilots.

190
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:55,722
And besides...

191
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:59,810
I'll be on a special boat made 
to evade mines.

192
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,588
This is specially made?

193
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:24,598
Hey, are you our new sharpshooter?

194
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:25,666
I'm Shikishima.

195
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:26,852
Sailor?

196
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:28,020
Fighter pilot.

197
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,291
What? This guy's useless.

198
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:31,893
You're ex-airman?

199
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:34,631
Just a military castoff.
Worthless.

200
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,534
Disappointed?

201
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,805
Seeing this boat?

202
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,214
The US and imperial navies laid
60,000 mines off Japan's coasts.

203
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:49,222
All kinds. But the worst are
the American magnetic mines.

204
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:52,969
Any approaching boat made of metal 
sets them off.

205
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:57,422
Ah, hence the wood.

206
00:22:58,563 --> 00:22:59,707
The boy catches on fast.

207
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,945
We mostly handle moored mines.

208
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,329
But wood boats are the best
countermeasure.

209
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:10,094
I'm Noda.

210
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:14,597
I developed naval weapons
during the war.

211
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,743
Boat captain Akitsu, and Mizushima.

212
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:19,436
“The Kid” and “Doc.”

213
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,803
Not fond of that nickname.

214
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,809
And I'm not a "kid."

215
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,243
You're still green, so "Kid" it is.

216
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:29,616
I know, I know. I wasn't in the war.

217
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:33,885
This is the minesweeper Shinseimaru.
Paired with Kaishinmaru.

218
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:39,265
The mines rise up from the seabed
like balloons on strings.

219
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,204
Between our two boats, is a cable 
with a cutter.

220
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,135
All we do is clip the mine wire...

221
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,279
and it floats to the surface.

222
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:52,783
Then we fire on it with this baby,
rat-tat-tat-tat.

223
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,158
Take a look.

224
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:06,609
Well...

225
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,079
this one's a bit tricky.

226
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,048
May I give it a try?

227
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,640
Are you sure?

228
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:23,088
You have to estimate it's position
accounting for the movement.

229
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:31,103
Whoo-hoo!

230
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:33,807
Nice shot!

231
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:36,344
Same with jet fighters.

232
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:38,481
Not that I saw any real action.

233
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:39,616
What?

234
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:45,169
You didn't? That makes me 
and Shikishima equals.

235
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,630
Hardly. You can't fly a plane.

236
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,735
If I'd gone to war, I would've learned.

237
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,606
If only it had lasted longer.

238
00:24:56,873 --> 00:24:58,849
You'd better not mean that.

239
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,230
No, sorry.

240
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,496
You fool.

241
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:41,598
Fire! Fire! Fall back!

242
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,252
You all right?

243
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:09,154
Another bad dream?

244
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,174
Dream.

245
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:23,183
Right.

246
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:27,016
I was dreaming.

247
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,555
Or maybe...

248
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:38,735
you're just a dream.

249
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:41,772
- What's wrong with you?
- Tell me.

250
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,203
This is Japan, right?

251
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:47,054
I returned alive, for sure, right?

252
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,579
- I returned alive!
- Stop!

253
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:11,215
Yes, I know.

254
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,051
I know.

255
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:16,357
I know.

256
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:23,125
July 1946 Bikini Atoll,
Operation Crossroads

257
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,500
Nice place you built here.

258
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:25,982
"Shikishima"

259
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,430
Worth every saved penny.

260
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,520
Drink?

261
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:36,704
Oh, why thank you.

262
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,565
May I take a photo?

263
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:46,072
- Please don't waste your film.
- That smile!

264
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:48,043
Hold it. Hold it.

265
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:49,478
Got it.

266
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:53,752
- Thank you.
- Hey Doc.

267
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,655
No coveting now.

268
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:59,500
Of course not.
Noriko's a married woman.

269
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:01,164
Please stop.

270
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,967
I'm not a wife.

271
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:07,308
What does that mean?

272
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,380
She just moved in on her own.

273
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:14,386
She had no place to go,
so I let her stay.

274
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:15,989
And the child?

275
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,096
She brought her, too.
But they aren't related.

276
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,702
Akiko was orphaned in the air raids.

277
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,460
- Wow, that's a beautiful story.
- No.

278
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,689
It just sort of happened.

279
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:34,478
Daddy.

280
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:39,161
- Akiko.
- What?

281
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:42,767
I told you. I'm not your father.

282
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,724
Shikishima.

283
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:49,779
- Don't say that.
- That's truly harmful.

284
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:54,720
Fate has brought you together 
as a family.

285
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:56,623
Accept it. Embrace it.

286
00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:00,066
Make them happy!

287
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:01,716
Enough!

288
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,935
I don't want that.

289
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:11,047
Why not?

290
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:21,531
March 1947

291
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:29,174
Welcome home.
I just returned myself.

292
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,889
What are you wearing?

293
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:36,286
How does it look?

294
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,301
I got a desk job in Ginza.

295
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,473
But don't I give you enough money?

296
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:51,555
It's time I stood on my own two feet.

297
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:55,743
At this rate, you'll never find a wife.

298
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,575
Have you seen how fast Ginza
is rebuilding?

299
00:31:04,611 --> 00:31:05,679
This is so sudden.

300
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,516
Not for me, it isn't.

301
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,114
What about Akiko?

302
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:17,631
What will you do with Akiko
while you are away at work?

303
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:21,237
Sumiko has promised to look after her.

304
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:27,381
She was very excited, boasting she'd 
raised three kids already.

305
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:33,676
In that case, I suppose it's all right.

306
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,284
Thanks. I'll go get Akiko now.

307
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:54,151
Pacific Fleet Destroyer USS Lancaster was 
attacked and disabled by an unknown enemy

308
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:56,176
No further detail is known at this time.

309
00:31:56,855 --> 00:32:00,511
Intercepting a distress call from 
Pacific Fleet attack submarine USS Redfish.

310
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:04,175
Reporting pusuit of a massive 
under-sea organism through pacific waters.

311
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:08,659
After successfully photographing target, 
Redfish made contact and was destroyed.

312
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:13,517
Wreck reconnaissance picked up high radioactive emissions where
hull collided with enemy creatures skin.

313
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:22,216
The colossal sea creature is projected 
on a course...

314
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:26,739
to reach the Japanese archipelago 
within a few weeks.

315
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:32,968
General Douglas MacArthur
stated with regret...

316
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,210
that recent Soviet movements prevent 
US military assistance...

317
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:40,881
but called upon Japan...

318
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:45,373
to begin strengthening 
its security forces.

319
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:51,811
May 1947
Near the Ogasawara Islands

320
00:32:58,811 --> 00:32:59,945
What did this?

321
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:02,979
A giant shark?

322
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,215
Or a whale?

323
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,388
No shark or whale could do that.

324
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,858
A new Soviet weapon?

325
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,828
That's not weapon damage.

326
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,498
Then what could it be?

327
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:17,966
- An enormous creature.
- Like what?

328
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:20,858
Just admit you have no clue.

329
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:24,163
I was skeptical until I saw this.

330
00:33:26,864 --> 00:33:27,669
Godzilla.

331
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,376
Look there!

332
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,484
Floating deep sea fish.

333
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:39,397
Just like on Odo Island.

334
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:41,827
What did you see there?

335
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:45,983
It was like a prehistoric dinosaur
turned monster.

336
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,319
The local inhabitants called it "Godzilla."

337
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:52,779
Godzilla?

338
00:33:52,952 --> 00:33:56,467
Nonsense. You were half asleep
and saw an enemy tank.

339
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:00,592
Believe me or not,
something wiped out...

340
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,597
the entire garrison on Odo.

341
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,033
Hold on.

342
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:08,307
I thought the Americans did that.

343
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:13,705
Odo was never targeted by
US island-hopping forces.

344
00:34:14,229 --> 00:34:17,550
It was a repair base for kamikaze planes.

345
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,183
Does that mean...

346
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:23,531
you were a kamikaze pilot?

347
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,478
If this is the same Godzilla I saw...

348
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:36,920
it must have grown much larger
and more powerful.

349
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,432
Hold on a second.

350
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:48,239
Why were we called out here 
to begin with?

351
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:53,312
They don't expect us to fight that 
in this boat!

352
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,782
Yes, they do.

353
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,489
We obviously don't stand a chance!

354
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:03,363
That's a US warship!
What can we do in this little rig?

355
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,200
Stall for time.

356
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:07,203
Stall?

357
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:10,576
The Takao is coming from Singapore.

358
00:35:11,332 --> 00:35:12,980
The heavy cruiser?

359
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,451
Rather than scuttle it,
it's being returned.

360
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:20,402
That's good news!
The Takao's a beast!

361
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:24,450
So we've been ordered to stall for time.

362
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:28,168
Why can't the US handle it?
It's their ship.

363
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:31,612
They're worried about the Soviets.

364
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,896
Any military maneuvers would 
raise alarms.

365
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:38,590
They prefer we handle the small stuff.

366
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,669
This isn't small stuff,
and all we've got is a 13 mm gun.

367
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:46,136
I was told to make use 
of recovered mines.

368
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:51,123
Ah, now I see!
This is why they called us out here.

369
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:55,185
Plus our main weapon has to be
locally scavenged?

370
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:59,545
Nor are we allowed to talk about it 
to anyone.

371
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:02,663
There it is. Their favorite gag order.

372
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:06,062
This country never changes.

373
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:08,569
Perhaps it can't.

374
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:19,653
Take a breather.

375
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,677
Thank you.

376
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:26,516
Don't push yourself too hard.

377
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,026
I can't help it. This is Godzilla.

378
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:37,496
I hear you.
When I start remembering the war...

379
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:40,378
I can't sleep sometimes.

380
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:43,159
I have to avenge them.

381
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:45,311
But at the same time...

382
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,412
I'm terrified of that thing.

383
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:58,343
We'll need more than a pair of those.

384
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:05,918
What is it?

385
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:28,247
There are way more of these fish
then I saw off Odo.

386
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:34,419
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

387
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,044
Godzilla's coming!

388
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:37,984
Sound the alarm!

389
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:41,256
So it's coming, huh?

390
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:44,528
Hey Kid! Prepare to drop the mines!

391
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:46,331
- Roger!
- Man the gun!

392
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:49,035
We can't fight it on this!

393
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:51,539
- We can still flee!
- Agreed.

394
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:54,277
- Doc, stand aft and report!
- Captain!

395
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:56,296
Kashinmaru, do you copy?

396
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:59,546
Get ready to land a big one!

397
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:02,819
<i>We're taking all the credit for victory.</i>

398
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:04,726
- You idiot.
- Captain!

399
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:08,218
If we run, Takao will never catch up.

400
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:10,506
And the monster heads for Tokyo.

401
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,074
I don't want to see it in flames again.

402
00:38:14,174 --> 00:38:16,344
But this boat is no match for it!

403
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,181
I thought you hated government orders.

404
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:22,377
With a passion. But you know what?

405
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:25,559
Somebody's got to do it.

406
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:45,002
Okay, never mind!

407
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,472
Doc, the engine!

408
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:52,315
I'm working on it!

409
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:53,642
Shikishima!

410
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,321
Shikishima!

411
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:58,926
Hurry! Over here!

412
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,932
- Captain!
- I know!

413
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,121
- Full throttle!
- Right!

414
00:39:26,216 --> 00:39:27,756
Drop the mines!

415
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,098
We'll never make it!

416
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:33,315
So try anything!

417
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:54,496
Now, Kid!

418
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:56,131
Here goes!

419
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,026
Did we get it?

420
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:10,706
No, we did not!

421
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:13,401
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad...

422
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:14,879
Shikishima, the gun!

423
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:15,814
Roger!

424
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,185
Shikishima!

425
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:38,356
Completely ineffective!

426
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:45,206
The mouth! What about in the mouth?

427
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:51,645
Reel! Reel! Reel!

428
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:52,848
Drop it!

429
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:02,241
Mizushima, now!

430
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:03,398
Right!

431
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:14,945
What? No!

432
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:16,486
No!

433
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:31,069
Get down!

434
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,128
Did we get it?

435
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:04,374
No!

436
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:31,649
Takao!

437
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,568
They made it!

438
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:02,570
Oh no!

439
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:40,762
Is it down?

440
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:53,246
What's that?

441
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:55,438
You're finally awake.

442
00:44:58,213 --> 00:44:58,711
Where am I?

443
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,936
A Yokosuka hospital.
We were airlifted here.

444
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:07,436
What about Kaishinmaru and Takao?

445
00:45:14,485 --> 00:45:15,458
Godzilla.

446
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:18,663
What happened to it?

447
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:21,501
Whereabouts, unknown.

448
00:45:21,903 --> 00:45:26,011
It was headed for Tokyo.
We need to sound the evacuation.

449
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:29,544
The government is not telling 
the public.

450
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:31,784
Why? We must hurry!

451
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,189
To prevent mayhem and confusion.

452
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,980
Are you kidding me?
We need to begin evacuating now!

453
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:41,095
No one will take responsibility...

454
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,558
for the chaos.

455
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:46,366
Information control is Japan's specialty.

456
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:57,413
Tell me what happened.

457
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:01,787
It's got nothing to do with you.

458
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:06,445
What is it that torments you so badly?

459
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:12,889
You took me in, saved me,
and we've been together since.

460
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:17,396
But you won't let me into 
any part of your life.

461
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:27,293
If you're carrying some burden...

462
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:30,799
I wish you'd share it with me.

463
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:43,703
I'm...

464
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:46,975
someone...

465
00:46:57,077 --> 00:46:58,311
who fled my duty...

466
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,711
as a Kamikaze pilot.

467
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:07,220
What?

468
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,450
On the day of my sortie...

469
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:14,692
I pretended my plane was faulty.

470
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,205
And made a detour...

471
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,630
landing on Odo Island.

472
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:36,229
These are photos...

473
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:41,374
belonging to the mechanics there.

474
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:47,459
They all perished.

475
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:02,520
That night...

476
00:48:04,274 --> 00:48:07,612
a dinosaur-like monster came ashore.

477
00:48:11,151 --> 00:48:12,219
I was asked...

478
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,120
to shoot it with the gun on my fighter.

479
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:20,472
But I froze up...

480
00:48:26,131 --> 00:48:27,513
and ran again.

481
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:31,935
When I came to the next day...

482
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:37,920
I found them all dead.
People longing to see their families!

483
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:44,287
The monster...

484
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,740
was called Godzilla.

485
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,771
The other day, it reappeared.

486
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:00,784
And once again...

487
00:49:03,677 --> 00:49:05,552
I couldn't do anything.

488
00:49:15,158 --> 00:49:16,693
I'm someone...

489
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,638
who wasn't supposed to live.

490
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,796
Listen to me.

491
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:35,848
Everyone who survived the war
is meant to live.

492
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,919
- How do you know?
- I just do!

493
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:43,661
As flames took my parents,
they ordered me to live.

494
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:48,602
So whatever happens next,
I know I must survive!

495
00:49:49,955 --> 00:49:51,624
That's kept me going.

496
00:50:04,426 --> 00:50:05,631
I can't.

497
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:12,442
They beckon to me in my dreams 
every night.

498
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,846
“Hurry and come” they say.

499
00:50:15,737 --> 00:50:18,635
"Why are you still cheating death?"

500
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:23,421
It's just a dream, ghosts you created.

501
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:24,595
Maybe it's an illusion.

502
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:29,370
What if I'm really dead already?

503
00:50:31,624 --> 00:50:33,281
I died long ago on that island...

504
00:50:34,302 --> 00:50:35,370
and lie rotting.

505
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:42,682
You and Akiko are just the last
dream of a dead man.

506
00:50:42,828 --> 00:50:45,328
That must be it! It has to be!

507
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:47,022
You are alive!

508
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,600
You are alive, Koichi.

509
00:50:57,686 --> 00:50:58,617
Can't you feel it?

510
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,589
Okay, hold the spoon.

511
00:51:17,058 --> 00:51:20,129
Gently, gently.

512
00:51:20,396 --> 00:51:22,332
- Grip it firmly.
- Okay.

513
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:27,803
Good, now stir the broth.
You're doing great!

514
00:51:28,677 --> 00:51:31,548
- There, it's done!
- Yeah!

515
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:35,254
I added your favorite, radish.

516
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:37,524
- Radish!
- Taste it for me.

517
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,794
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

518
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,502
First the soup, then the radish.

519
00:51:57,412 --> 00:51:58,225
Can I...

520
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,491
put this all to rest?

521
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:11,803
I'd like to try to live again.

522
00:52:31,054 --> 00:52:33,658
Is that what I think it is?

523
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,225
Hurry and report it.

524
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:39,000
Hurry!

525
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:40,335
Yes, Sir!

526
00:53:00,684 --> 00:53:05,457
Patrols report the Creature is
heading east toward Tokyo Bay.

527
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:07,645
Is it close then?

528
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,737
- What is it?
- I don't believe it.

529
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:13,170
Is it here?

530
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:16,049
Is that really a living thing?

531
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:23,507
This is Tokyo Bay Defense, requesting 
permission to detonate Zone 4!

532
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:25,858
It's almost here.

533
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:31,812
Entering Zone 4!

534
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:34,420
- Now!
- Detonate!

535
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:38,476
Status?

536
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:40,346
No good.

537
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:42,082
It had no effect!

538
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:46,445
Blockade breached!
It's heading to Shinagawa!

539
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,493
And it is gargantuan!

540
00:53:52,423 --> 00:53:53,423
Oops.

541
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:55,705
Thank you.

542
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:11,862
<i>This is an emergency news report!</i>

543
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:16,890
<i>A giant sea creature has come 
ashore near Ginza.</i>

544
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:21,631
<i>Those near Ginza, follow police 
instructions and evacuate.</i>

545
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:23,718
- <i>This is not a hoax.</i>
- Ginza!

546
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:33,508
Are you hurt? You okay?

547
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:09,638
What's going on?

548
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:11,180
What just happened?

549
00:55:29,005 --> 00:55:31,742
Is that... Godzilla?

550
00:56:50,117 --> 00:56:55,525
It's a scene that defies belief,
a giant creature on the loose...

551
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,364
trampling Ginza underfoot!

552
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,403
Tearing whole buildings apart!

553
00:57:02,538 --> 00:57:06,677
The Nippon Theater, a beloved icon 
of the people...

554
00:57:06,678 --> 00:57:09,114
is crumbling before our very eyes!

555
00:57:09,817 --> 00:57:15,024
The Ginza survived the air raids
but not this! This monster...

556
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,328
has turned it to rubble!

557
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:21,268
And now the monster is coming this way!

558
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:26,510
I can see its enormous head
passing in front of us!

559
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:29,436
It's dangerously close!

560
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:54,593
Move!

561
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:04,844
Get up!

562
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,051
- Koichi!
- Do you want to live? Come on!

563
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:53,450
Did they get it?

564
00:59:36,645 --> 00:59:37,332
This is...

565
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:40,192
the same as before.

566
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:35,025
Noriko.

567
01:00:37,939 --> 01:00:38,869
Noriko!

568
01:00:41,532 --> 01:00:42,502
N-Nori...

569
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:22,349
<i>Damage wreaked by the giant creature...</i>

570
01:02:22,568 --> 01:02:25,388
<i>includes some 30,000 killed 
and injured...</i>

571
01:02:25,716 --> 01:02:28,504
<i>and 20,000 homes and 
buildings destroyed.</i>

572
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:33,898
<i>Recovery operations are underway,
but the path the creature took...</i>

573
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:37,537
<i>carries the risk of radiation that
is impeding progress.</i>

574
01:02:37,939 --> 01:02:43,450
<i>Police have cordoned off central Ginza
to collect shards of the creature...</i>

575
01:02:43,848 --> 01:02:49,157
<i>which are of unknown composition
and potentially hazardous.</i>

576
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:05,895
I'm so sorry.

577
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:12,755
What now for Akiko?

578
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:17,770
We pull together, that's what.

579
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:19,630
Hey Akiko.

580
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:28,217
You like playing with me when
Dad's away at work, right?

581
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:30,188
Where's Mommy?

582
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:41,372
Mommy had to go away 
for a little while for work.

583
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,312
But you'll have me with you, okay?

584
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:34,328
You can't forgive me, is that it?

585
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,274
It's my fault...

586
01:04:44,617 --> 01:04:46,320
for thinking I could dream again.

587
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:02,438
Mr. Shikishima.

588
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:09,688
There's actually a strategy being hatched
to defeat Godzilla...

589
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,039
led by private citizens.

590
01:05:14,383 --> 01:05:16,359
It lacks any real basis for viability,
but...

591
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:21,188
will you take part?

592
01:05:28,088 --> 01:05:31,797
<b>"Special Disaster Countermeasure Hearing"</b>

593
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,091
- Wait, everyone here is...
- Yes.

594
01:05:40,392 --> 01:05:42,895
- Ex-navy personnel.
- You're informed.

595
01:05:43,842 --> 01:05:45,006
Really?

596
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,751
I'm ex-"Yukikaze" Destroyer Captain Hotta.

597
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:11,626
As you all know, Tokyo again faces...

598
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,345
an unprecedented crisis, this time, 
a monster attack.

599
01:06:17,063 --> 01:06:21,595
But we have no defense apparatus
of our own to protect our people.

600
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:27,407
What's more, any GHQ-led military
action runs the risk of escalating...

601
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:29,462
US-Soviet tensions.

602
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:36,071
In short, we must confront the monsters
with our strengths as private citizens.

603
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,212
This is why we've gathered you here.

604
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:44,501
But we've negotiated the use of 
four destroyers...

605
01:06:44,845 --> 01:06:47,477
originally slated for handover to the UN.

606
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:50,597
Are you saying...

607
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,906
you want us back on navy ships?

608
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:55,878
I saw what it did in Ginza.

609
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:58,484
There's no way to defeat it.

610
01:06:58,718 --> 01:07:02,858
Especially from boats that have 
been disarmed.

611
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:04,361
You're dreaming!

612
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:08,467
That's what I'm here to explain 
if you'll allow.

613
01:07:09,035 --> 01:07:10,270
Mr. Noda?

614
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:12,073
The plan...

615
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:16,146
Pardon me.

616
01:07:17,383 --> 01:07:22,320
The plan was drafted by me,
Kenji Noda, ex-Navy technical officer.

617
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:24,527
The first thing to know...

618
01:07:25,162 --> 01:07:29,936
is that this creature the people
of Odo Island call “Godzilla”...

619
01:07:30,104 --> 01:07:33,375
cannot be hurt by conventional firearms.

620
01:07:33,643 --> 01:07:38,717
I saw it take heavy artillery fire
from the guns of Takao...

621
01:07:39,209 --> 01:07:40,921
but quickly heal itself.

622
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:45,110
Quiet, please.

623
01:07:45,345 --> 01:07:48,081
So we need a totally different approach.

624
01:07:50,286 --> 01:07:53,032
Let me give you a demonstration.

625
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:56,061
This is concentrated salt water.

626
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,630
This wood model is weighted down
just enough to barely float.

627
01:08:01,655 --> 01:08:06,496
What happens if we pipe in freon gas,
enveloping it in bubbles?

628
01:08:06,654 --> 01:08:10,903
That's easy. Bubbles or not,
it would stay afloat.

629
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:14,709
That's what you'd think.

630
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:22,650
It sinks!

631
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:29,840
The freon bubbles prevent the model
from seawater contact.

632
01:08:29,974 --> 01:08:35,583
My idea is to entrap Godzilla like this
and sink it to the ocean floor.

633
01:08:35,884 --> 01:08:39,990
Did you have any idea Doc was
such a bigwig?

634
01:08:40,058 --> 01:08:40,992
No.

635
01:08:54,034 --> 01:08:56,816
At over 1,500 meters in depth...

636
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:00,847
the Sagami Trench is the deepest
place in nearby waters.

637
01:09:01,264 --> 01:09:06,557
The plan is to strap freon cylinders
to Godzilla and let them foam.

638
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:08,660
We create a bubble membrane.

639
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:13,568
It'll sink so rapidly that
the pressure will crush it.

640
01:09:16,775 --> 01:09:19,077
We kill it with the power of the sea.

641
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:23,518
That's the outline for
Operation Wada Tsumi.

642
01:09:24,755 --> 01:09:28,693
It's of the sea. Won't it 
withstand the pressure?

643
01:09:29,879 --> 01:09:35,955
After 25 seconds, every square
meter applies 1,500 tons of pressure.

644
01:09:36,524 --> 01:09:41,798
Even ocean-born creatures cannot
bear such rapid pressure change.

645
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:43,105
Can you promise...

646
01:09:43,937 --> 01:09:46,240
that would kill Godzilla?

647
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,631
Godzilla is an unknown organism.

648
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:54,035
We can only predict what will happen.

649
01:09:58,478 --> 01:10:01,148
But this is our best alternative.

650
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:03,443
Will it kill it? Or will it not?

651
01:10:06,299 --> 01:10:08,201
I can't absolutely guarantee it.

652
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:11,774
Shikishima!

653
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,597
It can be done!

654
01:10:18,788 --> 01:10:19,787
Mr. Shikishima.

655
01:10:21,324 --> 01:10:23,093
Hear me out, please.

656
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:42,926
Now let's get to the details.

657
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:51,911
Two ships will corral Godzilla 
and wrap it in cable.

658
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:58,657
The cable will have multiple 
freon gas cylinders attached to it.

659
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:04,358
The gas will be released 
as it's being tied.

660
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:09,408
And Godzilla will take a rapid 
plunge of 1,500 meters.

661
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,181
What if that fails?

662
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:12,880
There is a Plan B.

663
01:11:14,384 --> 01:11:16,892
Look into the courtyard.

664
01:11:35,757 --> 01:11:36,557
Inflate!

665
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:44,677
I'm Itagaki of Toyo Balloon.

666
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:46,556
What you just saw...

667
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:50,390
is an inflatable levitation device 
like the kind...

668
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:52,566
used in navy aircraft.

669
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:57,965
CO2 is shot into air sacs for 
buoyancy. It's a life preserver.

670
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,438
When Godzilla hits the floor...

671
01:12:01,606 --> 01:12:05,044
We raise it quickly back up 
to the surface.

672
01:12:05,245 --> 01:12:11,522
If it bears the pressure, it'll then 
contend massive decompression.

673
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:15,962
I can't say for sure 
that it wouldn't survive.

674
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:18,634
But we must do what we can.

675
01:12:24,194 --> 01:12:26,530
You've all survived a tragic war.

676
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:31,973
So it pains me to ask you again
to put your lives on the line.

677
01:12:32,107 --> 01:12:34,610
But understand this.

678
01:12:35,012 --> 01:12:38,684
We can't rely on the US
or Japanese government.

679
01:12:38,885 --> 01:12:42,223
So the future of this country 
is in our hands.

680
01:12:45,096 --> 01:12:46,199
I can't do it.

681
01:12:48,473 --> 01:12:49,903
I have a family.

682
01:12:50,402 --> 01:12:53,441
And that goes for most people here.

683
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:57,616
Why are we always the ones
drawing the short straw?

684
01:12:59,057 --> 01:13:01,355
We got enough of that in the war.

685
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,050
Please.

686
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:11,988
I beg you to listen very carefully.

687
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:18,265
This is not an order.
You're all free to leave if you wish.

688
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:22,173
We have no right to stop you.

689
01:13:46,585 --> 01:13:47,654
This plan...

690
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,258
does it mean certain death?

691
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,404
Of course not.

692
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:59,288
Then it definitely beats wartime.

693
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:03,395
It can't be helped.

694
01:14:04,798 --> 01:14:06,195
Someone has to do it.

695
01:14:06,935 --> 01:14:09,338
Who can sail the ships if not us?

696
01:14:09,606 --> 01:14:10,640
That's right.

697
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:14,848
- Well, then! Are we in, boys?
- Yeah!

698
01:14:23,872 --> 01:14:24,663
My friends...

699
01:14:27,236 --> 01:14:28,404
thank you.

700
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:30,497
Hear, hear!

701
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:44,023
What a surprise, to find you're the 
mastermind of such a grand plan.

702
01:14:44,057 --> 01:14:47,261
Well, I've had a direct encounter.

703
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:49,698
So the task fell to me.

704
01:14:49,723 --> 01:14:52,909
And we were called for the same reason.

705
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:55,995
Do you think Godzilla will return?

706
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,853
I think we can assume that Godzilla

707
01:15:01,054 --> 01:15:04,714
has added Tokyo to "its territory."

708
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:08,318
I expect it'll be back within 10 days 
at the latest.

709
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:09,787
That soon?

710
01:15:10,115 --> 01:15:12,987
Did you set up radiation-detecting buoys?

711
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:16,259
Visual detection isn't enough.

712
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,767
How can you expect it to
walk right into your trap?

713
01:15:21,035 --> 01:15:23,438
- I can't.
- What, no plan?

714
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:27,210
Who do you think I am?
Of course, I have a plan.

715
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:32,553
We have acoustic minesweepers.

716
01:15:32,788 --> 01:15:37,361
We use speakers to play
a recording of Godzilla's voice.

717
01:15:37,696 --> 01:15:39,197
- Its voice?
- Yeah.

718
01:15:39,432 --> 01:15:43,872
It'll see it as another
territorial competitor.

719
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:46,036
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?

720
01:15:46,674 --> 01:15:48,121
You don't instill confidence.

721
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:51,481
And that levitation device?

722
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:54,794
I can't envision that working well.

723
01:15:54,862 --> 01:15:56,630
Any other ideas, then?

724
01:15:56,731 --> 01:16:00,273
I know!
We pull it up with the destroyers.

725
01:16:00,297 --> 01:16:00,702
Idiot!

726
01:16:00,726 --> 01:16:05,912
Godzilla weighs some 20,000 tons.
Too heavy for two destroyers.

727
01:16:06,714 --> 01:16:07,856
Oh.

728
01:16:08,718 --> 01:16:12,390
In short, your plan is full of holes.

729
01:16:12,992 --> 01:16:16,797
If you have a better one, let's hear it.

730
01:16:19,035 --> 01:16:20,069
Mr. Noda.

731
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:25,427
Can you get ahold of a fighter plane?

732
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:27,465
Fighter plane?

733
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:32,369
I could anger it with gunfire
and draw it to Sagami Bay.

734
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:35,779
All planes were decommissioned.

735
01:16:36,347 --> 01:16:39,885
Even if you could, it shoots a heat ray.

736
01:16:40,087 --> 01:16:43,169
You risk your life flying so close.

737
01:16:43,216 --> 01:16:44,794
I'll take that risk.

738
01:16:45,287 --> 01:16:48,709
A fighter jet is more nimble than a boat.

739
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:52,786
You're not aiming to get shot down, 
are you?

740
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:55,316
Do you have a death wish?

741
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:57,817
You're drunk.

742
01:16:58,372 --> 01:17:00,592
You just want to avenge Noriko.

743
01:17:02,102 --> 01:17:03,141
Problem with that?

744
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,999
It's too late.

745
01:17:07,397 --> 01:17:10,568
You should've married her before!

746
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:13,106
You knew how she felt.

747
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,623
Don't you think I wanted that, too?

748
01:17:16,946 --> 01:17:18,655
Then why didn't you?

749
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:21,868
Because...

750
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,680
my war isn't over yet.

751
01:17:56,197 --> 01:17:58,752
- You found a plane?
- Yes.

752
01:17:58,877 --> 01:18:00,689
But it's a unique one.

753
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:25,714
It was developed at the end of the war,
the Local Fighter Shinden.

754
01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:28,750
Designed to shoot down bombers.

755
01:18:28,952 --> 01:18:31,522
And hit speeds over 400 knots

756
01:18:31,523 --> 01:18:36,598
It's got a tail wing, four 30 mm guns, 
and it's nimble as hell.

757
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:40,337
It's a plane full of innovations.

758
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:44,844
Only a few prototypes were 
field deployed.

759
01:18:45,213 --> 01:18:51,823
They were kept here for a mainland 
battle that never came.

760
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:56,430
They were left to rust,
and are in bad shape.

761
01:18:57,645 --> 01:19:00,348
It's not air worthy as is.

762
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,966
What we need is a top mechanic.

763
01:19:04,009 --> 01:19:07,113
Someone who knows their way 
around a jet fighter.

764
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:13,089
I know just the person.

765
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,889
Ex-Odo Island detachment mechanic?

766
01:19:18,983 --> 01:19:21,370
- Sosaku Tachibana.
- Got it.

767
01:19:21,571 --> 01:19:24,575
Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana.

768
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:28,147
No known current address.

769
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:32,383
- Sorry.
- We're swamped with search requests.

770
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:34,725
This will take time.

771
01:19:34,893 --> 01:19:37,530
I need to locate him urgently.

772
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,351
So does everybody.

773
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:42,455
- I beg you, please!
- What?

774
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:45,125
The country's future depends on it!

775
01:19:45,293 --> 01:19:48,297
I'm sure, but I can't do the impossible.

776
01:19:48,638 --> 01:19:49,349
Sorry.

777
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:50,871
Well then...

778
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:54,491
where was he posted before Odo Island?

779
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:56,094
Then where was he?

780
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:05,920
I've asked everywhere.

781
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:09,990
But this Tachibana probably
doesn't want to be found.

782
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,909
We can find another mechanic.

783
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,887
Any other leads?

784
01:20:16,294 --> 01:20:17,919
Just wait a bit longer.

785
01:20:19,452 --> 01:20:21,973
Why must it be him?

786
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:23,893
Godzilla can come at any time.

787
01:20:24,094 --> 01:20:26,163
It has to be Tachibana!

788
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,352
He's going to get my message.

789
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,806
Please!

790
01:20:59,117 --> 01:20:59,999
Tachibana.

791
01:21:01,616 --> 01:21:04,976
Mr. Tachibana! It's really you!

792
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:10,336
What's this about?

793
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:15,367
Wait.

794
01:21:18,148 --> 01:21:22,327
The Odo Island massacre was 
all my fault?!

795
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,042
Are you serious?

796
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:28,297
I'm sorry.

797
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:34,146
I knew if I angered you,
you'd come find me.

798
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:36,122
How dare you?

799
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:40,086
The Ginza attack...

800
01:21:41,535 --> 01:21:42,672
was the same as Odo.

801
01:21:44,312 --> 01:21:45,554
It was Godzilla.

802
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,295
I need you to repair a fighter for me.

803
01:21:57,878 --> 01:21:59,472
So I can kill it!

804
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:05,128
I needed to find you,
to ask for your help.

805
01:22:05,878 --> 01:22:08,548
That's why I wrote those letters.

806
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:11,720
Please forgive me!

807
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:18,782
You're on your own.

808
01:22:20,507 --> 01:22:22,141
I'm not helping you.

809
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,141
No, wait, Mr. Tachibana!

810
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:30,949
Please listen to me!
I need your help killing Godzilla.

811
01:22:31,343 --> 01:22:34,979
It's something only you can do.

812
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:41,460
I burst a mine in its mouth,
and hurt it more than ship guns.

813
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:44,717
It's vulnerable from the inside.
You get me?

814
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:47,903
You don't mean...

815
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:54,998
I can kill it if I fly a plane full of
explosives into its mouth.

816
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:02,610
Kamikaze...

817
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,768
The war isn't over...

818
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,791
for you, either.

819
01:23:15,445 --> 01:23:19,418
- You got that injury falling down?
- Ow.

820
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:23,157
It's swelling up like a grapefruit.

821
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:26,162
It's embarrassing, but I was drunk.

822
01:23:26,263 --> 01:23:28,333
I barely remember it.

823
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,908
I guess you deserved to celebrate
after finding Mr. Tachibana.

824
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:36,429
Tail wing, huh?

825
01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:40,302
I'd heard rumors,
but they actually did it.

826
01:23:42,816 --> 01:23:43,978
Mr. Tachibana.

827
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:47,037
Thank you all for coming!

828
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:49,193
You're Mr. Tachibana?

829
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:57,123
So this is the Phantom 
Local Fighter Shinden, huh?

830
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,128
Can you make this fly?

831
01:24:03,523 --> 01:24:05,570
We'll do all we can.

832
01:24:06,266 --> 01:24:07,473
Thank you.

833
01:24:09,029 --> 01:24:11,623
Good luck. Good luck.

834
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:30,447
What's wrong?

835
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:34,337
Brighten up, Mastermind.
It's bad for morale.

836
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:37,067
I know it's my plan.

837
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:41,307
But I'm feeling we'll need
a miracle to make it work.

838
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:45,714
Doing nothing won't cause
a miracle, either.

839
01:24:46,049 --> 01:24:47,217
You're right.

840
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,805
Take a look at these guys' faces.

841
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:54,008
They're not stupid.

842
01:24:54,586 --> 01:24:57,586
They know they're risking their lives.

843
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,375
And yet...

844
01:25:00,599 --> 01:25:03,437
their faces are beaming.

845
01:25:04,038 --> 01:25:09,339
They're happy. This time,
they'll make a difference.

846
01:25:09,881 --> 01:25:12,351
Make a difference.

847
01:25:13,837 --> 01:25:16,240
We all came through war.

848
01:25:17,331 --> 01:25:20,581
This time, we're making it right.

849
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:36,098
<b>"2nd Floor Conference Room 3,
Special Disaster Countermeasure HQ"</b>

850
01:25:36,182 --> 01:25:37,016
Hurry up!

851
01:25:40,589 --> 01:25:41,657
Make room.

852
01:25:43,312 --> 01:25:46,850
One hour ago, east off Hachijo Island...

853
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:51,024
33.10 north, 140.01 east...

854
01:25:51,108 --> 01:25:54,713
We got Geiger readings from 
multiple buoys.

855
01:25:55,248 --> 01:25:56,015
Followed by...

856
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:58,920
here and here.

857
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:15,683
Godzilla's coming.

858
01:26:16,621 --> 01:26:17,955
At last.

859
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:23,532
At this rate, it's due to arrive 
over the Sagami Trench...

860
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:25,927
at 1100 hours tomorrow, 
which means...

861
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:30,021
We have to mobilize and 
be in positions by 0800.

862
01:26:32,363 --> 01:26:33,398
But tell me...

863
01:26:33,912 --> 01:26:36,236
will your device be ready by then?

864
01:26:37,787 --> 01:26:39,107
Take us with you.

865
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:41,712
The final 3 hours will be critical.

866
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:44,193
We want it perfect.

867
01:26:44,263 --> 01:26:48,075
But you could get caught in the fight.

868
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,521
We've all seen war, too.

869
01:26:56,857 --> 01:27:03,576
Then everybody, go home tonight.
Spend the time with your families.

870
01:27:05,404 --> 01:27:06,912
You mean... be prepared?

871
01:27:11,943 --> 01:27:13,037
Come to think of it...

872
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:18,552
this country has treated life
far too cheaply.

873
01:27:20,076 --> 01:27:21,795
Poorly armored tanks.

874
01:27:22,998 --> 01:27:28,927
Poor supply chains resulting in half of
all deaths from starvation and disease.

875
01:27:30,467 --> 01:27:35,271
Fighter planes built without 
ejection seats.

876
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:40,959
And finally, kamikaze and 
suicide attacks.

877
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,998
That's why this time...

878
01:27:46,969 --> 01:27:49,216
I'd take pride in a citizen-led effort...

879
01:27:51,443 --> 01:27:54,123
that sacrifices no lives at all!

880
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,982
This next battle...

881
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:00,724
is not one waged to the death.

882
01:28:02,553 --> 01:28:04,677
But a battle to live for the future.

883
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:09,513
-Yes
-Yes

884
01:28:09,802 --> 01:28:10,691
Let's do it!

885
01:28:10,716 --> 01:28:14,849
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

886
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,326
Finally, tomorrow's the day.

887
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,868
- I can't wait.
- You're not going.

888
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,704
What do you mean?

889
01:28:26,729 --> 01:28:29,720
You're useless with that hand, anyway.

890
01:28:30,657 --> 01:28:32,025
Even Shikishima's going!

891
01:28:33,134 --> 01:28:34,861
Because I'm not a veteran?

892
01:28:35,486 --> 01:28:37,147
I can be useful.

893
01:28:37,321 --> 01:28:39,751
Not having been to war...

894
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:43,224
is something to be proud of.

895
01:28:49,775 --> 01:28:51,611
I want to defend my country, too.

896
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:57,087
Take me with you!

897
01:28:59,906 --> 01:29:02,470
We've been a team for a long time!

898
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:05,598
I'm begging you!

899
01:29:06,892 --> 01:29:08,303
Take me with you!

900
01:29:09,071 --> 01:29:10,775
I want to go with you!

901
01:29:10,808 --> 01:29:13,344
We leave you the future.

902
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:14,846
Captain!

903
01:29:15,248 --> 01:29:16,683
Mr. Noda!

904
01:29:28,178 --> 01:29:30,013
A little lower.

905
01:29:30,388 --> 01:29:31,616
Careful.

906
01:29:47,514 --> 01:29:49,526
Here you go, Akiko.

907
01:29:58,882 --> 01:29:59,948
I want to...

908
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,357
thank you for everything.

909
01:30:17,124 --> 01:30:18,459
Akiko.

910
01:30:19,412 --> 01:30:21,013
Was it fun with Auntie?

911
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,348
It was fun.

912
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,787
Good. I'm glad.

913
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:30,623
Is that for me?

914
01:30:32,732 --> 01:30:33,725
Thank you.

915
01:30:39,614 --> 01:30:41,279
- Akiko.
- Hm?

916
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:46,332
Is this you, me and mom?

917
01:30:47,251 --> 01:30:49,454
That's mom there.

918
01:30:50,657 --> 01:30:51,992
I see.

919
01:30:53,358 --> 01:30:54,569
It's really good.

920
01:31:05,663 --> 01:31:07,288
Why do you look sad?

921
01:31:12,596 --> 01:31:13,824
What's wrong?

922
01:31:14,376 --> 01:31:15,544
Akiko.

923
01:31:16,374 --> 01:31:18,241
There there.

924
01:31:21,952 --> 01:31:25,394
It'll be all right.
I'm not leaving you.

925
01:32:41,929 --> 01:32:43,124
Mr. Tachibana.

926
01:32:45,171 --> 01:32:46,085
It is ready?

927
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,069
Give me a minute.

928
01:33:03,304 --> 01:33:04,577
The bomb you ordered.

929
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:10,350
2 machine guns, 140 kg... 
120 rounds, 80 kg...

930
01:33:11,077 --> 01:33:13,231
And one main fuel tank, 400 kg removed.

931
01:33:14,241 --> 01:33:18,339
Instead, a No. 25 bomb in the nose,
and No. 50 in the fuselage.

932
01:33:20,554 --> 01:33:22,787
Now, I can finally pay them back.

933
01:33:37,661 --> 01:33:38,733
That's funny.

934
01:33:43,475 --> 01:33:45,473
Part of me wants to live.

935
01:33:50,288 --> 01:33:52,334
Same as all the men that day.

936
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:55,540
They all wanted to go home.

937
01:33:57,277 --> 01:34:02,786
But instead, they got squashed 
like bugs.

938
01:34:05,093 --> 01:34:06,107
I understand.

939
01:34:29,382 --> 01:34:31,702
This was drawn by a girl named Akiko.

940
01:34:33,811 --> 01:34:35,374
I want to protect her future.

941
01:34:40,265 --> 01:34:43,710
I will stop Godzilla no matter what.

942
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:46,530
You're finally ready.

943
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:52,569
Then, this is important.

944
01:34:53,702 --> 01:34:54,354
Look here.

945
01:34:56,264 --> 01:34:57,860
The bomb's safety.

946
01:34:58,835 --> 01:35:00,796
Pull it right before flying in.

947
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:01,554
Got it?

948
01:35:03,796 --> 01:35:04,874
One more thing.

949
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,368
Akiko.

950
01:35:18,788 --> 01:35:21,226
Are you all by yourself?

951
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,262
Look.

952
01:35:30,482 --> 01:35:32,085
“To Sumiko...”

953
01:35:44,655 --> 01:35:49,257
"Look after Akiko.
Use this money for her."

954
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,686
From Daddy?

955
01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:03,061
Huh? Yeah, from Daddy.

956
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:06,358
It's all right. Don't worry.

957
01:36:24,014 --> 01:36:28,642
This is Kuroshio 12, 
35.03 N, 139.41 E.

958
01:36:28,694 --> 01:36:30,397
Many deep sea fish found!

959
01:36:49,264 --> 01:36:57,684
<i>Godzilla is sighted in Sagami Bay!
Underwater guidance decoy activated.</i>

960
01:36:58,163 --> 01:37:01,360
Take only the essentials with you!

961
01:37:02,123 --> 01:37:03,766
Hurry and board!

962
01:37:04,016 --> 01:37:04,685
Let's get a move on.

963
01:37:07,233 --> 01:37:08,787
Mizushima took our advice?

964
01:37:08,788 --> 01:37:10,356
It's the best thing for him.

965
01:37:10,373 --> 01:37:13,044
I didn't want Shikishima to fly, either.

966
01:37:13,315 --> 01:37:16,047
A failed kamikaze pilot?
It worries me.

967
01:37:16,109 --> 01:37:19,758
He's got Akiko.
He'll make it back alive.

968
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:32,988
<i>Underwater decoy team destroyed!</i>

969
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:38,361
<i>Godzilla has entered Sagami Bay!
Wada Tsumi ships, leave port now!</i>

970
01:37:39,115 --> 01:37:39,814
Look.

971
01:37:40,985 --> 01:37:42,019
There!

972
01:37:42,488 --> 01:37:44,157
It's already here.

973
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:58,837
<i>Godzilla's through the final defense line!
Heading for shore!</i>

974
01:38:00,525 --> 01:38:01,511
I'm off!

975
01:38:56,098 --> 01:39:00,400
Time to end it once and for all, 
Shikishima.

976
01:39:01,249 --> 01:39:08,401
<i>Leave port now! Repeat.
Wada Tsumi ships leave port now!</i>

977
01:39:14,614 --> 01:39:17,379
What now? The plan's ruined!

978
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:19,462
We embark anyway.

979
01:39:19,855 --> 01:39:24,525
We need to sink it over 
Sagami Trench or it won't work.

980
01:39:25,048 --> 01:39:28,259
Shikishima will have to lure it!

981
01:39:28,478 --> 01:39:29,404
Move out!

982
01:39:29,539 --> 01:39:30,272
Let's go!

983
01:39:46,907 --> 01:39:49,032
Radio from Mr. Shikishima!

984
01:39:50,939 --> 01:39:55,393
I'm in the air preparing to lure
Godzilla to target area.

985
01:39:55,626 --> 01:39:57,363
We'll be ready.

986
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,140
<i>Get there quickly.</i>

987
01:39:59,165 --> 01:40:04,143
Don't do anything rash! I won't 
forgive you if you orphan Akiko.

988
01:40:07,282 --> 01:40:08,853
You hear me, Shikishima!

989
01:40:11,149 --> 01:40:12,923
He's ignoring me.

990
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,431

991
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:39,548
Coming.

992
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:47,325
Yes?

993
01:40:47,494 --> 01:40:48,928
Ms. Shikishima?

994
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:52,935
- Telegram.
- Thanks.

995
01:42:17,032 --> 01:42:19,978
Wow. Way to lure it out!

996
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:23,892
Godzilla looks really ticked off.

997
01:42:24,365 --> 01:42:25,275
It's in pursuit.

998
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:27,368
Our turn now.

999
01:42:30,806 --> 01:42:32,251
All ships, battle positions!

1000
01:42:32,252 --> 01:42:34,782
All ships, battle positions!

1001
01:42:37,454 --> 01:42:38,431
Freon cylinders ready!

1002
01:42:38,907 --> 01:42:41,462
46 cm cannonballs ready!
Levitation switch ready!

1003
01:42:41,665 --> 01:42:43,062
Cables ready!

1004
01:42:43,525 --> 01:42:45,366
All circuits ready!

1005
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:48,240
Power on, release safety device!

1006
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:07,440
That's it. Keep coming.

1007
01:43:09,077 --> 01:43:12,549
- Team 1 attack as planned.
- As planned!

1008
01:43:44,183 --> 01:43:45,704
Atta boy.

1009
01:44:22,562 --> 01:44:25,476
That's Godzilla's heat ray.

1010
01:44:28,222 --> 01:44:33,128
The ships won't survive this.
All ships must evacuate!

1011
01:44:33,181 --> 01:44:34,721
No, this is okay.

1012
01:44:34,806 --> 01:44:36,275
Stick to the plan.

1013
01:44:36,314 --> 01:44:38,189
But the heat ray!

1014
01:44:38,214 --> 01:44:42,142
Once fired, it takes time to regenerate.

1015
01:44:43,001 --> 01:44:43,861
We go now!

1016
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,712
Give the order!

1017
01:44:52,111 --> 01:44:54,303
Commence Operation Wada Tsumi!

1018
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:16,697
Fire 46 cm cannonballs, cylinders 
and levitation switch!

1019
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:43,197
Shikishima!

1020
01:46:09,662 --> 01:46:10,830
Crane deployed!

1021
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:11,611
Roger!

1022
01:46:12,834 --> 01:46:14,962
Maintain course, Hibiki!

1023
01:46:15,197 --> 01:46:17,173
Hibiki, maintain course!

1024
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:20,626
Maintain speed, some damage inevitable.

1025
01:46:25,275 --> 01:46:27,603
Hibiki is closing in, 4 meters!

1026
01:46:28,677 --> 01:46:29,759
2 meters!

1027
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:33,891
- Brace for impact!
- Brace for impact!

1028
01:46:48,481 --> 01:46:53,014
- Crossing complete! Full speed!
- Full speed!

1029
01:47:08,184 --> 01:47:10,017
Yes! Yes!

1030
01:47:10,868 --> 01:47:12,904
- Captain, the switch.
- Roger!

1031
01:47:21,942 --> 01:47:23,610
Oh no. Not yet?

1032
01:47:25,282 --> 01:47:26,172
Almost.

1033
01:47:36,907 --> 01:47:38,813
Ready...

1034
01:47:48,486 --> 01:47:50,422
Hit it, Captain!

1035
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,344
- Freon!
- Got it!

1036
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:15,297
Depth 1,200 meters! 1,300 meters!

1037
01:48:15,932 --> 01:48:17,834
- 1,400 meters!
- Keep going!

1038
01:48:18,002 --> 01:48:19,737
- Dive!
- 1,450 meters!

1039
01:48:20,974 --> 01:48:24,812
1,500 target passed!

1040
01:48:37,233 --> 01:48:39,740
We sunk Godzilla!

1041
01:48:40,164 --> 01:48:41,186
Did it succeed?

1042
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:50,780
Persistent bugger.

1043
01:48:51,315 --> 01:48:53,615
- Move to Plan B.
- Do it.

1044
01:49:12,543 --> 01:49:14,145
Now rise

1045
01:49:14,697 --> 01:49:19,271
Depth 1,200 meters! 1,100 meters 
1,000 meters!

1046
01:49:27,802 --> 01:49:29,037
Cables stopped!

1047
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:31,780
They stopped at 803 meters!

1048
01:49:33,334 --> 01:49:35,514
Why? Why did they stop?

1049
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:41,201
It chewed through?

1050
01:49:44,561 --> 01:49:46,803
Hibiki, pull Godzilla up!

1051
01:49:47,105 --> 01:49:48,701
90 degrees max speed!

1052
01:49:48,834 --> 01:49:51,545
The two ships lack the thrust.

1053
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:55,021
We've no choice.
Give it all you can!

1054
01:49:55,536 --> 01:49:56,279
Yes, sir!

1055
01:50:13,366 --> 01:50:14,536
At this rate...

1056
01:50:15,236 --> 01:50:16,570
the crane won't hold.

1057
01:50:16,771 --> 01:50:18,039
Clear out!

1058
01:50:41,254 --> 01:50:45,177
<i>This is Yokohama tugboat Fujimaru!</i>

1059
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,568
<i>Doing our best to help!</i>

1060
01:50:47,802 --> 01:50:48,950
That voice.

1061
01:50:50,006 --> 01:50:52,497
Mizushima here.
Is that you, Captain?

1062
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,771
Kid, is that you?

1063
01:50:56,622 --> 01:50:57,411
You bet!

1064
01:50:57,982 --> 01:51:01,380
<i>This is Toyo Kisen's Koeimaru,
here to help.</i>

1065
01:51:01,544 --> 01:51:05,119
<i>And Yokohama Eisen's Nikkomaru!
At your service!</i>

1066
01:51:05,144 --> 01:51:06,898
<i>Shiokazemaru, assisting!</i>

1067
01:51:06,923 --> 01:51:07,890
<i>Tetsuyumaru.</i>

1068
01:51:08,092 --> 01:51:09,626
<i>- Nanamimaru.
- Minamimaru.</i>

1069
01:51:09,677 --> 01:51:11,296
<i>- Kisshomaru.
- Junseimaru.</i>

1070
01:51:11,497 --> 01:51:12,832
<i>- Wakamaru.
- Heimitsumaru.</i>

1071
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:14,034
<i>Tenyumaru.</i>

1072
01:51:14,268 --> 01:51:15,636
<i>- Kaiomaru.
- Hyuga.</i>

1073
01:51:15,838 --> 01:51:17,106
<i>- Choukamaru.
- Shuseimaru.</i>

1074
01:51:17,307 --> 01:51:18,541
<i>- Taramaru.
- Yasakamaru.</i>

1075
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:21,560
The useless to the rescue!

1076
01:51:25,176 --> 01:51:26,621
I'll be damned.

1077
01:51:26,856 --> 01:51:29,607
I gotta admit I'm glad to see him.

1078
01:51:29,927 --> 01:51:33,433
All you tugboats out there!
Let's catch a Godzilla!

1079
01:51:33,584 --> 01:51:37,411
- Everybody pull!
- Everybody pull!

1080
01:52:02,431 --> 01:52:05,193
Godzilla's rising again!

1081
01:52:06,732 --> 01:52:09,880
Come on, show your face!

1082
01:52:10,261 --> 01:52:12,599
Depth 700 meters!

1083
01:52:13,533 --> 01:52:15,247
Keep coming, keep coming!

1084
01:52:46,087 --> 01:52:47,622
It's not damaged enough!

1085
01:52:48,755 --> 01:52:50,919
All ships evasive action!

1086
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:43,390
What's he doing?

1087
01:53:43,592 --> 01:53:44,169
No.

1088
01:53:48,661 --> 01:53:50,736
- Don't.
- Stop!

1089
01:53:50,937 --> 01:53:52,405
Shikishima!

1090
01:54:19,434 --> 01:54:20,466
Shikishima…

1091
01:54:35,595 --> 01:54:37,263
No, look!

1092
01:54:42,161 --> 01:54:43,140
I see him.

1093
01:54:45,177 --> 01:54:46,045
I see him!

1094
01:54:48,966 --> 01:54:52,029
<i>Pilot ejected! He's alive!</i>

1095
01:55:00,927 --> 01:55:03,378
This seat has an ejection button.

1096
01:55:04,943 --> 01:55:06,161
Just pull that lever.

1097
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:11,185
Live.

1098
01:55:14,029 --> 01:55:14,927
Mr. Tachibana.

1099
01:56:45,879 --> 01:56:47,021
Shikishima!

1100
01:56:52,598 --> 01:56:53,505
You did it!

1101
01:56:54,724 --> 01:56:55,927
You did it!

1102
01:56:57,958 --> 01:56:59,052
Kid!

1103
01:57:03,185 --> 01:57:03,997
Sumiko!

1104
01:57:04,233 --> 01:57:05,235
Koichi!

1105
01:57:06,371 --> 01:57:08,874
- Koichi!
- Akiko!

1106
01:57:15,286 --> 01:57:15,927
What?

1107
01:57:57,828 --> 01:57:59,697
Is your war...

1108
01:58:01,835 --> 01:58:03,336
finally over?
